hello everyone,
    I am the master-chef kartik sayal known for world famous unique food recipes.
    few days ago I received a mail from a person saying , he wanted me to make a recipe for him
    that would be super delicious and extremely healthy.

    So while thinking about the recipe I realised that soup is the thing liked by everyone and is very tasty.
    now my first step of deciding the dish was over . But now the main task was how to make it healthy.

    I came to the conclusion that vegetables are the most healthiest .

    Now my task was to combine vegetables with soup.

    So I made a recipe called Vegetable-Soup!!
